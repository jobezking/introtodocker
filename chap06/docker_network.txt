Docker network drivers
1. Bridge: default network driver. Suitable for standalone containers that need to communicate
2. Host: removes network isolation between container and Docker host 
3. Overlay: enables communication beween containers across multiple Docker daemon hosts
4. MacVLAN: Assigns MAC address to container, making it appear as physical device on network
5. None: disables all networking for container
6. Network plugins: allows use of third-party drivers
