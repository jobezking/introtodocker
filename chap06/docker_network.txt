Docker network drivers
1. Bridge: default network driver. Suitable for standalone containers that need to communicate
2. Host: removes network isolation between container and Docker host 
3. Overlay: enables communication beween containers across multiple Docker daemon hosts
4. MacVLAN: Assigns MAC address to container, making it appear as physical device on network
5. None: disables all networking for container
6. Network plugins: allows use of third-party drivers

docker network ls   - list all networks
docker network inspect <network_name>   -   get detailed info about network

docker network create --driver <driver> <network_name>  -  create new network
docker network create --driver bridge my_custom_network
docker network create --driver bridge --subnet 172.18.0.0/16 --gateway 172.18.0.1 my_custom_network

docker run --network <network_name> <image>     - start container from image and connect it to network
docker run --network my_custom_network --name container1 -d nginx
docker network connect <network_name> <container_name>      -   connect running container to network
docker network disconnect <network_name> <container_name>   -  disconnect container from network
docker network rm <network_name>    -   remove a network

Bridge networks: most commonly used and suitable for containers running on same Docker daemon host
    1. Each container connected to bridge network is allocated unique IP address
    2. Containers on same bridge network can communicate with each other using IP addresses
    3. Default bridge network has limitations so better to create custom bridge networks.
docker network create my_bridge
docker run --network my_bridge --name container1 -d nginx
docker run --network my_bridge --name container2 -d nginx

Host networks: adds a container to the host's network stack. Best networking performance at the expense of network isolation (NAT)
docker run --network host -d nginx          If container exposes port 80, it will be available on port 80 of host machine

Overlay networks: used in Docker Swarm mode to enable communication between containers across multiple Docker daemon hosts
docker network create --driver overlay my_overlay
When creating network service in swarm mode, attach it to overlay network:
docker service create --network my_overlay --name my_service nginx

MacVLAN: assigns MAC address to container, making it appear as physical device on network
docker network create -d macvlan \
    --subnet=192.168.0.0/24 \
    --gateway=192.168.0.1 \
    -o parent=eth0 my_macvlan_net

To run container on network: docker run --network my_macvlan_net -d nginx

Encryption
docker network create --opt encrypted --driver overlay my_secure_network

Network Plugins: Third party. Examples are Weave Net, Calico, Flannel
Service discovery: Docker provides built-in service discovery for containers on same network. Containers reach each other using container
names as hostnames. Swarm mode has built-in load balancing for services.

Troubleshooting
docker exec to enter container then use ping, curl, wget etc i.e. docker exec -it <container_name_or_id> /bin/bash; ping 8.8.8.8
docker network inspect [network_name]       -   view network information
docker port <container>     -   see port mappings for container
DNS info: i.e. docker exec -it <container_name_or_id> /bin/bash; cat /etc/resolv.conf 

Best practices
1. Custom bridge networks instead of default bridge network for better isolation and built-in DNS resolution
2. Use overlay networks for multi-host communication in swarm mode
3. Use host networking sparingly and only when high performance is needed
4. Be cautious when exposing ports only exposing what is necessary
5. Use Docker Compose for managing multi-container applications and their networks
