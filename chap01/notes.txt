Intro Concepts
1. Containerization: lightweight virtualization form packaging apps and dependencies
2. Docker Engine: runtime that lets you build and run containers
3. Docker image: read-only template used to create containers
4. Docker Container: runnable instance of a Docker image
5. Docker Hub: cloud-based registry for storing/sharing Docker images

Docker architecture
1. Docker client: primary way users interact with Docker via the client
2. Docker host: the machine running the Docker daemon (dockerd)
3. Docker daemon: manages Docker objects like images, containers, networks, volumes
4. Docker Registry: stores Docker images e.g. Docker Hub

Docker components
1. Dockerfile
2. Docker Compose: tool for defining and running multi-container apps
3. Docker Swarm: Docker's clustering and orchestration solutions
4. Docker Network: facilitates communications betweem containers
5. Docker Volume: provides persistent storage for container data

Basic workflow
1. Build: create Dockerfile that defines app and dependencies
2. Ship: Push Docker image to registry like Docker Hub
3. Run: pull image and run it as a container on any Docker-enabled host

docker build -t myapp:v1
docker push username/myapp:v1
docker run -d 8080:80 username/myapp:v1
