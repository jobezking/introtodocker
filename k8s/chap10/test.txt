Key Kubernetes Concepts
1. Pods: The smallest deployable units in Kubernetes, containing one
or more containers.
2. Services: An abstract way to expose an application running on a
set of Pods.
3. Deployments: Describe the desired state for Pods and
ReplicaSets.
4. Namespaces: Virtual clusters within a physical cluster.
